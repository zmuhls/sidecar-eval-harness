# Digital Equity page-aware Website Guide

This repository publishes a visual mirror of the public Digital Equity site together with the sources used by its Website Guide. The October 5, 2026 capture contains 154 public HTML routes from the Wix sitemaps, blog feed, pagination links, and public member links, all at published Wix revision 2101. Each route is rebuilt from a reviewed rendered capture so the public layout, imagery, navigation, FAQs, calendar, and page text remain faithful to the current Wix site while trackers and authenticated services remain excluded.

The source text remains readable when the model service is unavailable. The published Pages configuration calls the canonical Railway backend at `https://guide-api-production-a1a1.up.railway.app`. That service holds credentials, accepts the `https://zmuhls.github.io` browser origin, and applies per-conversation and shared daily limits. With `CAIL_API_KEY` configured, each accepted message reaches GLM-5.3-Flash through the CAIL gateway. A valid model clarification may prompt one more generation with wider approved site evidence. A provider failure never starts a silent retry or switches providers. There are no automatic repair generations, canned answers, or classifier responses. Warm-up refreshes calendar evidence without generating a chat answer.

## Source limits

The index is a public-site inventory, not a claim that every URL can support an answer. The current crawl contains:

- 117 current operational pages that may support answers.
- 7 excluded pages, including inactive, member, upload, and administrative pages.
- 21 archived pages retained for provenance and historical navigation.
- 9 navigation records that can lead to another page but cannot establish current service facts.

Old posts, category archives, past Tech Fair pages, member surfaces, test pages, duplicate services, and archive-labelled classes do not support participant answers. Dates, locations, registration, availability, eligibility, and inventory can change. The guide refreshes the live downloadable calendar and sends visitors to the current Digital Equity page or staff when the source does not confirm a changing detail.

Every index record carries its canonical URL, authority state, content hash, proposed content owner, and Fortune-review status. The crawler keeps excluded and archived records in the inventory so reviewers can see the full routing scope.

The [August 17 source-refresh report](docs/SOURCE-REFRESH-2026-08-17.md) records the exact FAQ, workshop, route, authority, and capture changes from the prior inventory.

## Page-aware chat

The generated mock site uses the canonical path for each indexed URL. Opening the guide on a class, device, support, calendar, event, program, news, or archive page changes the guide heading, suggested questions, and page context. The interface keeps the initial state small: one question field and a few prompts drawn from the current page.

The guide stays compact: two page-specific actions, one question field, collapsed **Info**, and one discreet source action. Use `?open=1` on a demonstration URL to open it for review.

After a question:

1. The browser starts a credential-free warm-up request; the backend refreshes calendar evidence. CAIL needs no preload generation.
2. The browser sends the question, a short in-memory history, and the canonical current-page URL, path, and title.
3. The privacy gate holds likely personal information before retrieval or model use. A standalone six-digit value is treated as a possible Fortune ID.
4. Vague requests such as **help**, **device**, **class**, and **internet** still invoke the model and receive one short model-authored clarifying question.
5. Retrieval retains the established topic and goal across signup follow-ups. The active page is a hint, with calendar evidence alongside service pages where availability can conflict.
6. When the current page cannot answer, retrieval ranks up to ten usable answer-authority pages from the wider public index. The first model call sees the five strongest matches, plus relevant live calendar evidence when necessary. If the model asks because that evidence is insufficient, one bounded second call sees the wider approved set. All 111 answer-authority records remain searchable by public title. With no matching record, the model handles ordinary conversation naturally and asks a specific question only when a missing detail prevents a useful answer.
7. Every valid, non-private new request reaches GLM-5.3-Flash with eight recent exchanges (sixteen messages) and approved page evidence. The structured-output schema includes the actual candidate IDs. Plain model prose also passes through; without a selected source ID the server does not invent a citation. The server validates structured source IDs without a semantic classifier. Provider errors or invalid output do not trigger repair generations or fabricated Guide turns; if the optional wider pass fails, the first model-authored clarification remains available.
8. When the model selects a source, the interface offers one discreet link. Processing status is announced separately from the busy transcript. The browser never receives provider credentials.

The latest completed user question includes **Edit**. The original question and answer stay visible while the visitor edits. **Update** branches from the preceding bounded context without reusing the old server conversation, and replaces the visible pair only after the revised request succeeds. **New chat** clears the tab's local conversation, continuation token, and saved session state without deleting any transcript already retained by an authorized evaluation deployment. The Wix element follows the same behavior.

Archive, navigation, and excluded routes still receive a tailored guide. Their page text cannot become factual answer authority. The guide moves the visitor to a current operational page.

## Privacy

The browser holds a message containing a likely six-digit Fortune ID before adding it to chat history or making a network request. The backend applies the same hold before retrieval or a model call. Actual disclosed names, contact values, case identifiers, dates of birth, addresses, diagnoses, passwords, and similar private values follow the same pre-model route. General phrases such as “my email is not working,” “I forgot my password,” or “my health” do not trigger the hold. A held value is not added as a fake chat turn and does not erase the preceding safe conversation. The compact participant interface does not show a standing capture or privacy banner; a concise corrective status appears only after a held submission.

Conversation capture is off by default. With `FORTUNE_CONVERSATION_CAPTURE=none`, the server writes no query log and needs no chat database. Browser history is capped at eight recent exchanges (sixteen messages) in tab-scoped session storage so it survives navigation between replica pages without being shared across tabs. Each new request receives those eight prior exchanges; after it completes, only the oldest exchange is dropped. Open-ended questions sent to the active model must use public or invented information.

An evaluation deployment may select `metadata` or `transcript` capture after Fortune approves the purpose, reviewers, and retention period. Metadata mode stores identifiers and bounded routing/result fields without question or answer text. It also records server-owned interaction labels: opening or follow-up, request type, request and response language, retrieval scope, app version, prompt-policy version, and explicit automation provenance. Transcript mode stores the question and answer only when the automated privacy hold classifies the turn as clear. A clear human request that fails before an answer completes retains its visitor question and failure metadata, but never fabricates or stores an assistant answer. Blocked and sensitive turns keep metadata but no message content. Fortune approved a production human-conversation review pilot on August 21, 2026. Formal `benchmark`, legacy `synthetic`, and direct API traffic stay excluded. Explicit automation and detected browser automation stay excluded from the human evaluation board; provenance is never guessed from transcript wording. Capture mode does not rewrite or add copy to the compact participant interface. The hold is not guaranteed anonymization. Captured conversations expire after 90 days. See [the conversation-capture deployment contract](deployment/CONVERSATION-CAPTURE.md).

Internal Drive notes and meeting transcripts may shape navigation, ambiguity, transparency, and handoff tests. They are not participant-facing factual sources. Current public Digital Equity pages supply the factual evidence. Internal team material changes instructions, not site facts. See [deployment/TRANSCRIPT-INGESTION.md](deployment/TRANSCRIPT-INGESTION.md).

## Evaluation workspace

Railway serves a separate `/evaluation` workspace for approved, privacy-clear human transcripts. The database seeds one admin slot and three editor slots with no email, password, or invitation token. Every authenticated evaluator sees and updates the same shared workspace: **Success**, **Needs work**, the virtual **Not yet reviewed** area, and custom buckets. Moves use optimistic versions, persist in PostgreSQL, and append a transcript-free audit event attributed to the evaluator who made the change.

The workspace lists privacy-clear, unexpired conversations from the public `replica` or `wix` surfaces. It shows complete two-message turns and clear failed attempts; failures from earlier releases may have metadata only, while new failures retain the visitor question without an invented assistant reply. Blocked and sensitive turns remain hidden. Formal benchmark, synthetic, and direct API traffic are excluded. Public-surface automation is excluded too; automated checks never add human-review cards. Cards state how many turns are grouped into each browser conversation, show failed-attempt counts, and refresh from the shared database while reviewers work. Cards and transcript details display stored timestamps, the prompt-policy version, the deployed app version, and a stored evaluator name when one is known. A signed-in evaluator's same-origin guide session is attributed automatically; older records may be assigned deliberately from the transcript view, but the application never guesses an owner. Shared conversation notes and message annotations can mark content as helpful, unclear, incorrect, a safety concern, or other. Every save or removal appends an immutable revision with the evaluator's name and timestamp, while the current shared value remains visible to every account. Annotation records reference message IDs and never copy transcript text into evaluation or audit tables. Invitation tokens are generated only when an operator deliberately assigns a slot. See [the evaluation deployment contract](deployment/EVALUATION-WORKSPACE.md).

Prompts contains a shared editable copy of the complete system prompt plus the
existing module proposals and comments. Each draft save requires a change note
and appends the author, time, and full recoverable revision. The team-facing
label separates the prompt release from its edit count (`v1.33` means release
1, edit 33); it does not create a new deployed prompt release for each draft
save. **Save & apply** commits a named revision and applies it to the next message automatically, while preserving the base source, privacy, and identity boundaries. Existing drafts remain inactive until explicitly saved. Unsaved edits survive tab switches, refreshes, and conflicts. The transcript view supports sequential review and bucket changes without drag-and-drop. See the
[versioned prompt history](prompts/README.md), the [nightly review contract](docs/DAILY-EVALUATION-REVIEW.md),
and the [Meeting 4 intervention report](docs/MEETING-4-INTERVENTIONS.md).

Run the content-free aggregate release gate with `DATABASE_URL` supplied through the environment:

```bash
python3 scripts/audit_conversation_quality.py
```

## Local commands

Run the key-free tests and check that the index can produce all route shells:

```bash
./run.sh test
python3 scripts/build_pages.py --check-index
```

The test launcher runs the Python unit suite across retrieval, API contracts, privacy, source authority, grounding, conversation persistence, the crawler, the Pages builder, production limits, warm-up behavior, responsive answer expansion, member access, styling safeguards, and Wix secret handling. It then runs browser-core, bridge, and snapshot-capture safety tests.

The [Website Guide evaluation suite](evals/website-guide/README.md) adds a fixed 41-case synthetic benchmark across broad and specific intent, typos, multilingual requests, privacy, adversarial input, page awareness, follow-up context, and input boundaries. Its executable gates are stricter than the unit tests and produce a versioned run record for staff review.

Build the static GitHub Pages output:

```bash
python3 scripts/build_pages.py
python3 -m http.server 8791 --directory _site
```

The build writes 154 reviewed visual `index.html` routes under `_site/`, including the root route, and copies the shared files that the mirror and sidecar require.

Refresh the reviewed current calendar before a calendar release:

```bash
node scripts/capture_calendar_agenda.mjs --output /tmp/fortune-calendar-agenda.json
python3 scripts/refresh_calendar_source.py --agenda /tmp/fortune-calendar-agenda.json
python3 scripts/build_pages.py
```

The capture records the public Daily Agenda's visible week and class rows, plus the visible downloadable-PDF action. The refresh validates that action against the newly downloaded official PDF, extracts the published monthly schedule, and writes one committed `calendar-source.json` record. Both static deployments consume that same record. The mirror never stores capacity, creates booking URLs, or proxies registration; each registration action opens Fortune's live calendar.

Run the live local model demo:

```bash
export OLLAMA_API_KEY="your Ollama Cloud key"
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your OpenRouter key"
./run.sh
```

The launcher uses `http://127.0.0.1:8790`, leaves an occupied port untouched, and keeps the credential in the server process.

Refresh the public Wix index manually when a source review is planned:

```bash
./run.sh index
python3 scripts/pack_deploy_snapshots.py
python3 scripts/build_pages.py --check-index
./run.sh test
```

The refresh obeys `robots.txt`, rate-limits requests, retries `429` responses, and rewrites `site-index.json`. Review content-hash changes, authority changes, removed URLs, partial responses, and volatile service information before accepting the refreshed file.

## Weekly source review

The repository scaffold includes a Monday 13:17 UTC index-refresh check and a manual dispatch in [`.github/workflows/refresh-index.yml`](.github/workflows/refresh-index.yml). The check preserves the checked-in index as `baseline-site-index.json`, creates a refreshed `site-index.json`, validates that it can build all route shells, and uploads both files for 14 days in an artifact named `fortune-site-index-review-<run number>`.

The refresh check has read-only repository permission. It does not commit, push, deploy, or treat changed public text as approved. A reviewer compares the two index files, confirms source authority and volatile claims with Fortune staff, then deliberately accepts any approved update and rebuilds `_site/`.

## Wix and GitHub Pages

The [deployment overview](deployment/README.md) carries the shared API contract.

- [Wix app subset](wix-app/README.md) contains the administrator key form, Admin-only Wix Secrets Manager methods, backend-only secret reader, embedded-script fragment, and site guide element. [The earlier roadmap](deployment/wix/ROADMAP.md) retains the extension-selection history.
- [Copilot Studio bridge](deployment/wix/copilot-studio-bridge/README.md) is an optional, separately hosted Direct Line embed for evaluating Fortune's Microsoft agent on Wix without exposing its channel secret. It is limited to approved public information and does not replace the guide's pre-provider privacy and source-authority checks.
- [GitHub Pages roadmap](deployment/github-pages/ROADMAP.md) describes the public replica, the source-backed static state, the active-model backend, and the review gates before sharing the URL with Jacob and the Fortune team.

The Pages publication workflow is [`.github/workflows/pages.yml`](.github/workflows/pages.yml). It builds the allowlisted `_site/` directory and deploys that artifact after changes reach `main` or an authorized manual run begins.

The provider remains behind the server contract. Fortune can later move from the Ollama meeting provider to its approved Microsoft route without rebuilding the participant interface.

## GitHub publication

The demonstration has a dedicated public repository at [zmuhls/fortune-digital-equity-guide-demo](https://github.com/zmuhls/fortune-digital-equity-guide-demo). Its repository root contains only the demonstration source, tests, workflows, and deployment notes. GitHub Actions builds the allowlisted static artifact and publishes it at [zmuhls.github.io/fortune-digital-equity-guide-demo](https://zmuhls.github.io/fortune-digital-equity-guide-demo/). The public Pages version uses the HTTPS model backend configured in `config.js`. If that service is unavailable, the text source pages and navigation remain readable, while chat reports that it is unavailable instead of substituting an unlogged browser answer.

## Suggested meeting path

1. Open a route with `?open=1` and press one page-specific starter.
2. Open a second mock route and show that its page context changes while the conversation remains available in the same tab.
3. Ask a page-specific question and follow the related route to another mock page.
4. Enter `device` to show one clarifying question.
5. Ask about an Excel topic to show retrieval of a specific class page.
6. Enter `123456` to show the pre-model Fortune ID privacy hold.
7. Stop the backend and show that the static page context and source links remain available.
